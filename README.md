## Site Usage

### Home: Our home page provides an overview of the site as well as our mission statement.

### BIAs Over Time: Depicts the creation of BIAs over time in a single map using MapBox’s time slider feature. The time slider is housed inside of a legend (bottom right) with a label that displays the corresponding year to the position of the slider toggle. BIA polygons appear as the slider is moved.  The time slider allows the user to explore the municipal-level spatial diffusion of BIAs over time. 

### Socioeconomic Data: The socioeconomic data map can be used to visualise the changing economic profiles of local neighbourhoods within BIA boundaries. For example, if the housing suitability decreases within Little Italy from 2006 to 2016, a relationship can be investigated between Little Italy’s BIA economic impact and the area’s decreasing housing affordability due to potential factors like gentrification. While association is not equivalent to causation, this tool can be used to identify possible local relationships within revitalization discourse and used by scholars, urban planners, and even affected residents to visualise and better understand dynamics of gentrification from improved tourist and business activity on a local neighbourhood scale. 

### Find a BIA: The Find a BIA page displays the BIAs as a card group that can be navigated either manually or through a search bar. Each card includes the BIA’s image, name, description, and a link to the external site. The Find a BIA page allows the user to focus on individual areas and access contextual information.
